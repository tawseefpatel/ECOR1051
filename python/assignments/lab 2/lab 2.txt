==========
Exercise 1 

What is the name of the frame containing variable "area_of_disk"?

	Global Frame

What does variable "area_of_disk" refer to?

	the variable refers to the area of a circular disk or circle defined by the formula
	pi(r^2)

What is the name of the frame containing parameter "radius"?

	Local (call) Frame

When does the frame appear in the memory diagram?

	it appears after the math module is imported 

What is the type and value of the variable "radius"? Where did that value come from?

	the type radius is an undefined variable however it was given a value of 3 in the formulae. 

How does PyTutor depict the value the function will return?

	it depicts the return value by following the return statement after receiving the input value 
	for the radius. 

When does the frame containing "radius" disappear?

	the radius frame disappears after the area print function has been executed 		

What is the name of the frame containing the variable "area"? 

	global frame

When does "area" appear in the frame?

	area appears in the frame after the print function is exceuted

What is the type and value of "area"? Where did that value come from?

	the type is float and has a value of 78.5398

==========
Exercise 2 

What value does "area_of_disk" return each time it is called?

	78.5398

==========
Exercise 3

What is the name of the frame containing parameters "inner" and "outer"?

	they are in the local (call) frame and are known as the arguments

When does the frame appear in the memory diagram?

	it appears after the area function is exceuted

What are the types and values of the variables "inner" and "outer"? 

	float with a value of 5.0 and 10.0 for inner and outer respectively. 

What caused those values to be bound to "inner" and "outer"?

	the last function call area = area_of_ring and the def area_of_ring (outer, inner)
	bounded the values to the arguments. 

What is the name of the frame containing parameter "radius"? 

	local (call) frame
	
When does that frame appear in the memory diagram? How many times does it appear?

	it appears when area_of_disk is defined and appears for 7 steps. 

Each time the frame containing "radius" appears, what is the type and value bound to "radius"? 
What caused that value to be bound to "radius"?

	the value that appears is the value bounded by outer and inner (10.0 and 5.0 respectively) 
	these values are flaots and are bounded to the argument radius because of the math module that was
	imported

When does the frame containing "radius" disappear?

	it disappears after the area_of_disk is executed 

When does the frame containing "inner" and "outer" disappear?

	when the code is complete and the area function is executed 

What is the name of the frame containing the variable "area"? 

	global frame

When does "area" appear in the frame?

	at the very end when it is executed 

What is the type and value of the variable "area"? What caused that
value to be bound to "area"?

	the value is 235.6194 and is a float. it is bounded by this value because the 
	arguments that are placed in the area_of_ring function and because of its return value


==========
Exercise 4 

What is the type and value of the object returned by the function when there is
no return statement?

	the return value is None and that is because the return function was not used in the 
	definition function. 

==========
Exercise 5

When "cube" is called, but before Python executes x = x ** 3, what value is
bound to parameter "x"? What value is bound to variable "a"?

	the value bound to x before x=x**3 is executed is a value of int 2. 
	the value bound to variable a is also 2. 

After Python executes x = x ** 3, but before the function returns, what value
is bound to parameter "x"? What value is bound to variable "a"?

	before the function is returned, x is bound to a value of 8 as this is the value of 
	pow(2,3). the variable a is still bound toa value of 2

In Python code, does assigning a value to a function's parameter change the 
corresponding function argument?

	yes assigning a value to a functions parameter changes to corresponding function argument
